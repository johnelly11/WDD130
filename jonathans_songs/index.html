            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Hello friends, and welcome to my personal motif repository!</h1>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                This site is broken up into three different pages. There is this page you are currently on that talks about my music background and good practice techniques, another page that has several of my motifs, or little bits of music that can inspire a greater works of music, and a page that has the sheet music pdfs of my motifs when available. Sadly, my music on this page is limited to motifs and half-baked musical ideas. I have been far too busy to help the pieces realize their potential, but hopefully someday I will be able to finish them and put them to good use in some sort of media. This site is designed for me to be able to easily share my ideas with friends and family without needing to pull up all the different apps or find old recordings across different devices that I used to write or store my compositions. I do claim full ownership over the use of anything found on this site and ask that none of it be plagiarized into any form of media, but feel free to take my ideas and make something out of them. If youâ€™d like to share, please contact me using my information below!

                Many people look at musicians and think, wow, I wish I was born with musical talent like they were. What I really want all those people, possibly including you, to know is, musical talent isn't something anyone is born with! Perfect pitch is really the only head start anyone can have, but everyone has some level of relative pitch that can be trained to the point where anyone would think you were born with perfect pitch! If you can hum a tune, or sing happy birthday, you eventually will be able to play any song you can think of on any instrument you want! It's all about practice.

                I was stubborn when I was young and my parents tried to get me to learn piano. They sent me to lessons once a week, but I never practiced outside of lessons and eventually my parents gave up on trying to help me. I didn't really touch music again until I was serving a 2 year full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Seoul, South Korea. For most of my mission, I served in small church branches in the countryside of Kangwon Province. One day a week, we had a preparation day where we did our shopping, household chores, and could call our family. One of those days, I finished calling my family, so while I was waiting for my companion, I sat at the piano and started messing around trying to read the sheet music for the church hymns. It was really hard and took me probably twenty minutes to play a single page of music. I had very low-level understanding of music notation from when I took lessons, but I didn't really comprehend what key signatures were or anything like that yet. I started doing that every week while my companion would do his family phone call because there really wasn't all that much else I could've done with all the missionary standards and rules in place.

                One day, I was plunking around like I usually did on preparation day when our Branch President, the presiding member of the branch, came in and found me playing the piano. He told me he didn't know I could play, and asked if I could play in church that Sunday because up until then, they just had a bluetooth speaker doing the hymns accompaniment. I said no because I wasn't good enough, and he said I should practice. I responded stating we don't have time in our schedule for practicing throughout the week because we had missionary standards we had to follow. Little did I know, he was about to contact our mission president about that. Our mission president ended up calling me and telling me that I need to be the accompanist and that I should practice during our lunch hour and our dinner hour whenever possible.

                I finished my mission very comfortable with sight-reading music, and fairly decent at playing any song by ear. I've since picked up electric guitar and I get better at playing by ear every day. But how did I do it? I actually just asked a musician I know, who's won seemingly numberless piano and cello competitions on the state and national level with perfect marks on everything, How I should practice if I only have an hour a day and need to be able to perform hymns every week for people to sing to. It really wasn't anything special, but the diligent everyday practice of the simple exercises is what got me to where I am. I literally just threw my head at the wall following the advice and everything I needed fell into place.

                These are the exact practice techniques I followed: Get a metronome. At 60bpm, do 2 Hanon exercises followed by 2 major scales, each major scale being played 1 octave for 1, 2 octaves for 2, and 3 octaves for 3 keys per beat. Then major arppegios following the same rules as the octaves, followed by major inversions for the two keys, one chord per beat. Do the same thing twice more at 72bpm and 80bpm. Use the same 2 Hanon and scales for an entire week before switching to 2 new ones of each. Only use the first 10 Hanon in the Hanon exercises book, and only focus on the white-key scales for the first year. Every time you finish a cycle of the 10 hanon, 2 at a time (should be every 5 weeks), up the bpm of each of the three speeds (old: 60, 72, 80) by 2 (new: 62, 74, 82). When practicing songs, go one single measure at a time to a metronome, slow enough that you can play the measure 3 times in a row without mistakes (usually 40-60bpm, and if you can't do that, you're probably learning something outside of your skill range and should back up a bit to easier music until you're ready). Do the same with each individual measure of the line, then put them all together, ensuring you are playing it slow enough to a metronome that you can play the line 3 times in a row without mistakes. Then start working on the next line. Then eventually chain the page together. Then all the pages together. Then when you can play the entire thing through 3 times in a row without mistakes, you bump the metronome speed up about 5bpm and play it through until you can do it 3 times without mistakes, and repeat until you have the song up to speed.

                That is all I did for one to two hours a day for about a year and a half, and each time I was transfered to a new branch, I was called as the accompanist, and I was able to do a good job at it, learning 3-4 new songs every week to perform with no mistakes. It definitely seems meticulous, but learning new skills never come from simply wishing for them. I learned a lot more than just a few songs from practicing that way though. When you spend that much time doing something, you tend to pick up patterns, and I learned a lot about how songs are formatted, and I learned how to hear music a lot differently than I was able to before. Those led me to be able to compose music without difficulty. I would even compose often without even having any instruments in front of me to hear how it sounds! I just knew how it would sound using skills I learned from practicing well.

                These are very real methods that all real musicians had to follow to some capacity when they were learning. These are slightly modified to accommodate a busy schedule, but they do work, and I am living proof of that. Music isn't a talent one is born with. It is the result of countless hours of hard work.
