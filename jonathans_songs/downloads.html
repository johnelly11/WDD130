             That may be a bit dramatic, but when you’re having to manually write and direct every link behind the scenes like I do, it starts to feel like a thousand, haha! Everything that has a pdf I could find is on this page. Some of the formatting may be different across different pieces because I had a major transition between flat.io and Musescore. Flat.io has cursed formatting because they are a bit stingy on wanting you to pay their ransom for anything more than a quarter note in 4-4 time, but everything exported from Musescore should look pretty standard. The pdf file should download just from clicking on the name of the piece, but if you run into any trouble, feel free to reach out. You can find my contact information down below, or if you have my number or something already, that works too. I might mess around with the formatting; maybe add an mp3 download for each piece too at some point, but that’s about all this page is. Please don’t rip or plagiarize these, I do own these pieces, but for sure reach out if you have any ideas or suggestions you want to run by me!
