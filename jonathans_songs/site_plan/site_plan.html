        Hello friends, and welcome to my personal motif repository! This site is broken up into three different pages. There is this page you are currently on that talks about my music background and good practice techniques, another page that has several of my motifs, or little bits of music that can inspire a greater works of music, and a page that has the sheet music pdfs of my motifs when available. Sadly, my music on this page is limited to motifs and half-baked musical ideas. I have been far too busy to help the pieces realize their potential, but hopefully someday I will be able to finish them and put them to good use in some sort of media. This site is designed for me to be able to easily share my ideas with friends and family without needing to pull up all the different apps or find old recordings across different devices that I used to write or store my compositions. I do claim full ownership over the use of anything found on this site and ask that none of it be plagiarized into any form of media, but feel free to take my ideas and make something out of them. If you’d like to share, please contact me using my information below!

      <h3>Audio Files Page</h3>
      <p>
        You made it to the main event! Welcome to my repository of compositions! Not everything I’ve made is in here yet, and I may update it from time to time. I started composing music in my downtime, just a few minutes a night, when I was living in South Korea; serving as a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was difficult at first because I was relatively new at music, I had no access to instruments in the apartment, and I didn’t have a lot of time to work on them. I would have to compose my ideas on physical music score, then on p-days, my one day off in the week—typically Monday, I would use the computer we had access to in the church to transcribe my music digitally to an online composition web app called flat.io to see if it sounded like I wanted it to. Nowadays, I use Musescore, an open-source application that is more capable in my opinion. If you want to see the pdf of any of these motifs, you will be able to find it under the same title in my pdf download page. Again, I ask that none of my pieces be ripped or plagiarized for use in any sort of media, but feel free to play with my ideas and contact me with what you make!

      <h3>PDF Download Page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the realm of a thousand hrefs! That may be a bit dramatic, but when you’re having to manually write and direct every link behind the scenes like I do, it starts to feel like a thousand, haha! Everything that has a pdf I could find is on this page. Some of the formatting may be different across different pieces because I had a major transition between flat.io and Musescore. Flat.io has cursed formatting because they are a bit stingy on wanting you to pay their ransom for anything more than a quarter note in 4-4 time, but everything exported from Musescore should look pretty standard. The pdf file should download just from clicking on the name of the piece, but if you run into any trouble, feel free to reach out. You can find my contact information down below, or if you have my number or something already, that works too. I might mess around with the formatting; maybe add an mp3 download for each piece too at some point, but that’s about all this page is. Please don’t rip or plagiarize these, I do own these pieces, but for sure reach out if you have any ideas or suggestions you want to run by me!
