            <p>I'm a Chemistry major, programming minor, but I want to go to law school after I graduate. I like to play electric guitar and compose music. I served in the Seoul, South Korea Mission.</p>
            <p>My favorite scripture is Doctrine and Covenants Section 130, verses 18-19 because it inspires me to learn all that I can in this life. <br>This scripture has helped me get on the path of life that I am currently on!</p>
            <p>"18 Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. <br>19 And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come."</p>
